	   Data provider is very good feature of TestNg.
	   It is also called TDD framework: Test Driven development- Along with writing of the code, 
	   															 we can also design our test cases in agile methodology
	   															 TestNg will help to design the test cases also. 
	   															 We can drive the test cases with help of TESTNg framework
	   Important for Interview/Frameworks
